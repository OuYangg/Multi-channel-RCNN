# Multi-channel-RCNN
This is a Pytorch implementation of Multi-channel RCNN for the task of (supervised) identification of spreading influence nodes in a graph, as described in our paper:

Ou Y, Guo Q, Xing J L, Liu J G, Identification of spreading influence nodes via multi-level structural attributes based on the graph convolutional network. ESWA, 2022, 117515 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117515 

The algorithm flowchart of M-RCNN is as follow:

**Notice:**
  The package `community` is required to run our code. If you have this problem, you can run:
  
  `pip uninstall community`
  
  `pip install python-louvain `
  
  `import community.community_louvain as community`
